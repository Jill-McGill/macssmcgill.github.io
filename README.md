## McGill Anatomy and Cell Biology Students' Society

The McGill Anatomy and Cell Biology Student Society aims to serve the academic and social needs of all students in Anatomy and Cell Biology! With so many Anatomy and Cell Bio classes this year rely on MACSS to provide NTCs of the highest quality. Our office is always open to visitors so come by to chat or if you need gloves or a lab coat!

Some of our famous events include our annual Halloween Sp00ky Apartment Crawl as well as our year-end formal, which students from all science departments attend. Throughout the year we hold many smaller events such as Gerts nights, breakfasts, and wine and cheeses so that Anatomy and Cell Bio students may interact with professors and other students.

The Anatomy and Cell Biology Program itself is amazing because it incorporates courses from many other biomedical departments such as physiology, biochemistry and biology. Some of our best courses include the Systemic Anatomy class (ANAT 214) and Histology (ANAT 261).
