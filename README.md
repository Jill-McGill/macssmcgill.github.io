## McGill Anatomy and Cell Biology Students' Society

The McGill Anatomy and Cell Biology Student Society aims to serve the academic and social needs of all students in Anatomy and Cell Biology! Our office is always open to visitors so come by to chat or if you need gloves, a lab coat, or NTCs of the highest quality!

Some of our famous events include our annual Halloween Sp00ky Apartment Crawl as well as our year-end formal, which is attended by students from a variety of departments. Throughout the year we hold many smaller events such as Gerts nights, breakfasts, and wine and cheeses to catalyse networking among professors and students.

The Anatomy and Cell Biology Program itself is amazing because it incorporates courses from many other biomedical departments such as physiology, biochemistry, and biology. Some of our best courses include the Systemic Anatomy class (ANAT 214) and Dynamic Histology (ANAT 261).
